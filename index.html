        <h2>The Flow of HTML</h2>
        <p>The flow of HTML is defaulted as left to right and top to bottom. This is how it exists in the document and that would be considered the "flow" of elements in HTML.
          <br>
          <br>
          In addition to the properties that it provides to style HTML elements, CSS includes properties that can change how a browser positions elements too. Their properties specify where an element is located on the page, if the element shares lines with other elements, and other related attributes.
        </p>
